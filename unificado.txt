Hello, World! 
Alicerce Educação was founded on May 24, 2018 by Paulo Batista. Graduated in Law from the University of São Paulo, it was through voluntary work as a teacher in the college's pre-university course that Paulo began his history in education. This was his first opportunity to see how outdated the basic education of students was.
